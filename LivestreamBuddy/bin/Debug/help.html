        <h3>Why is LivestreamBuddy's interface so frakken ugly?</h3>
        <p>Because I'm lazy and it's very beta.</p>
    </div>

        <h3>Why does it sometimes take a few moments before my viewer list populates?</h3>
        <p>The chat and viewer list utilize twitch's IRC servers.  Sometimes, when they are under high load, they will take a few moments to return data.</p>

        <h3>Why do I see a browser popup sometimes when you already have my credentials?</h3>
        <p><b>Short answer:</b> Blame twitch.<br /><br /><b>Long answer:</b> LivestreamBuddy actually uses two separate twitch interfaces.  The chat and viewer list come over twitch's IRC servers and everything else comes from their web API.  These two systems do not utilize the same authentication interface.</p>

        <h3>What should I do if I find a bug or have a feature request?</h3>
        <p>Go <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/livestreambuddy/" target="_blank">here</a> and use the "Tracking" feature, there should be a button or tab or something... you probably need to be logged into SourceForge.</p>

        <h3>I entered a bug or feature request using SourceForge's "Tracking" feature like you told me to.  Why isn't it done yet?</h3>
        <p>I'm lazy.  You want it done faster?  There's a donate button.  Money makes me go faster.</p>
